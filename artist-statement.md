# Artist Statement

## How have you interpreted/explored your chosen theme?

I explored the possibility of asteroid mining because the earth is going to run out of non-recycled resources in the future. The resources we want include platinum, gold, silver, and water.

After setting up the mining station on asteroids, we have 3 ways to use the resources. First, we can process the resources on asteroids, then send it back to earth. We can even make rockets on asteroids. Second, we can use asteroids as a rest station to deep space. For example, we can change water into hydrogen and oxygen, which is the fuel of rockets. In this way, rockets can carry less fuel, and we can explore the space deeper. Finally, we can bring the asteroid close to earth, like the space station, and get the resources as needed

However, we cannot ignore the danger of asteroid mining. Since asteroid mining will change the mass of asteroids, it will change the gravity of the environment, which may change the orbit of asteroids and the asteroids may hit the earth because of asteroid mining.

## How have you structured the experience (e.g. beginning-middle-end, or something else)?

There are 5 stages in my design. First, there is a welcome scene, which is used to wait for viewers to start the journey. After they start it, I tell them the current situation of the resources on the earth, and guide them to use the program, i.e. send the first rocket. Then, they will enter an interaction scene, which asks users to send rockets to asteroids. After that, I will show visitors two ways of using resources on asteroids. Finally, I will show them the danger of asteroids. And the experience will stop here.

## What are you trying to make the viewer think?

I want my viewers to aware the necessity and danger  of asteroid mining,. At the beginning, I want them to think about what we should do if we are running out of the resources. In the next part, I want them to know asteroid mining can bring us a lot. If we can do mining on asteroids, we will have more resources for human beings to develop. Besides, we can access  space deeper and deeper. Finally, we should also consider if the asteroids move towards the earth, do we have a method to handle it?

## What are you trying to make the viewer feel?

I want my viewers to have a journey with the program. When something happens in the program, not only the items on the screen will move, but also the sound will give viewers feedback. The control of the system is not hard, because I do not want my viewers to be so lost in the challenge that they forget the plot of the story.

Initially, the time bar will give them pressure. The pressure is from the game, but I want them to have a same feeling concerning the resources on the earth. I always want to give my viewer some surprise. Maybe the movement of the earth is not surprising enough, so I send the rocket by opening the earth. The rocket will bring them to a new scene with 5 asteroids. The next surprise is from the asteroids we can reach another scene with Mars! The viewer should never know what will happen in my game. They will not know there is a danger plot in my game. Then, the scene changes back to the first one, but the asteroids are heading towards the earth. When they are not sure what happened, the game is over. I will not tell them what we can do to solve the problem of the orbit changing problem. If they are curious, they can search by themselves, or they can imagine a solution.

## What do you hope the viewer tells their friends about your artwork after they leave the gallery?

I want them to chat with their friends what will happen if we run out of resources on the earth. I want them to tell their friends there is a way called asteroid mining, and it is not only a way for the lack of resources, but also a way to explore the universe in the future. I also want them to chat with their friends about the danger of the asteroid mining. They will tell their friends the orbit of asteroids may change because of asteroid mining. Then they can talk about what we can do if some asteroids are approaching the earth.
