# Statement of Originality

I <Jiuxin Zhu> declare that everything I have submitted in this major
project is entirely my own work, with the following exceptions:

## Inspiration

The inspiration of showing people the way we use the resources on asteroids and
the danger of astroid mining was inspired by Kit.

The inspiration of stopping the story when astroids are reaching the earth but
not giving a solution was inspired by Brent.

## Code

The way to resize the window was learned in lab9.
