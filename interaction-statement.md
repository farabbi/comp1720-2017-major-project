First, the viewer will see an Earth at the middle of the screen. A sentence is on the earth, "Click to Start". Then the viewer will click on it, if he or she is curious about the content of my work.

After clicking on the earth, a rocket will be sent off from the earth. The screen will move down, and 5 asteroids will appear at the top of the screen. The rocket will hit on one asteroid and a sign of mining will appear on the asteroid. Then some instruction will tell user to land on all asteroids.

Then the viewer will send another rocket by clicking on the earth again. This time the rocket will be guide by the mouse. Since the rocket will fly towards the mouse, the viewer will know how to control the rocket by themselves. As the rocket lands on asteroids one by one, the time bar will lose slower and slower.

Then another instruction will appear. Following the instruction, the user will click on an asteroid and a rocket will send from the asteroid to Mars. The rocket will bring us a new scene.
